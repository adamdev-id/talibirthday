                            Hi, talitha it's been awhile since we met.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am very impressed that you've made it this far!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am sorry i couldn't be there when you needed someone the most, when your heart was aching, asking for help silently.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am sorry i left you back then for my own good even though it was for the best for the both of us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am very proud of the Talitha you've managed to become today, don't worry! you are still the same old Talitha to me and please do not ever change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am happy that you've been living a happy life lately and i'll always pray that there will be more to come.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am happy that this time i'm able to stay with you on the least best version of myself, even though i'm still far from the word perfect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am very grateful you're getting alot of love that you deserve and you became closer with your friends that was distant because of such event.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After all the things that you've experienced, happy nor sad, It doesn't matter okay?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            what matters is you've learnt alot and you became the Talitha you are now today.
                        </p>
                        <br>

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It kind of made me realize me how i'm willing to change and adapt for the person i love ^^
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            and of course, how deep my love is when im in love.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If we're not destined together, i hope someone's able to accept you for who you are, looks at your soul before your appearance.
